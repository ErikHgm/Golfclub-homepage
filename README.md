This is a website made for a golf club called Los Naranjos in southern Spain. The main goal for this website is to inspire new and active golfers to play at the club and for the club to be able to effectively market itself online and showcase its various options of amenities, accommodations and practice areas towards those who are interested to play golf. It also has the convenience built in so that golfers can make their reservation and book a start time themselves online.
