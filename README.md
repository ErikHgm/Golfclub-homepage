This website is the homepage for a golfclub called Los Naranjos in southern Spain. The main goal for this website is to inspire both new and active golfers to play at the club and for the club to be able to effectively market itself online and showcase its various options of amenities, accommodations and practice areas towards those who are interested to play golf.

    - Color Scheme  
    For the color scheme I decided to go with the below colors which focus on elegance and exclusivity which is how the club aims to market itself to its intended target audience.     
    #DBCE8C

    - Typography  
    The main font used throughout the site for text is the font Kalam, with a fallback font of Cursive in case the font isn't imported correctly for any reason. The Kalam font is appealing and attractive looking font that matches well with the Charm font used for the logotype.

        The imagery has been carefully chosen in order to serve the purposes of both describing how the venue looks like and at the same time inspire new and current golfers to visit and start playing at the club.
